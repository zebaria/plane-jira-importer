# ✈ plane-jira-importer

Migrate issues from **Jira Cloud** to **[Plane](https://plane.so)** (self-hosted).

Interactive CLI that handles the full migration: issues, descriptions, comments, attachments, priorities, statuses, labels, assignees, and parent-child relationships.

Written in **TypeScript** with full type safety, built for reliability at scale.

## Features

- **Interactive project selection** — pick source (Jira) and target (Plane) projects from a list
- **Full issue migration** — title, HTML description, priority, status, labels, assignees, dates
- **Comment migration** — preserves author attribution and timestamps
- **Attachment migration** — downloads from Jira and uploads to Plane (3-step presigned upload)
- **Status → State mapping** — interactively map Jira statuses to Plane states (auto-matches by name)
- **User mapping** — map Jira assignees to Plane members (auto-matches by email)
- **Issue type labels** — creates "Jira: Bug", "Jira: Story", etc. labels in Plane
- **Priority mapping** — Highest→urgent, High→high, Medium→medium, Low/Lowest→low
- **Parent-child relationships** — preserves sub-task hierarchy
- **Incremental migration** — tracks migrated issues via `external_id` to avoid duplicates
- **Dry run mode** — preview what would be migrated without making changes
- **Jira reference links** — each migrated issue includes a link back to the original Jira issue

### Reliability & Scale

- **Retry with exponential backoff** — transient failures (5xx, 429, network errors) are automatically retried with jitter
- **Rate limiting on both APIs** — configurable request-per-minute limits for Jira and Plane
- **Per-issue error isolation** — one failed issue doesn't stop the entire migration
- **Fault-tolerant comments & attachments** — individual failures are logged and skipped, not fatal
- **Attachment size limits** — skip oversized files before downloading to avoid OOM
- **Retry-After support** — respects HTTP 429 `Retry-After` headers from both APIs
- **Structured summary report** — clear end-of-run report with counts, failures, and duration

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (22 recommended — see `.mise.toml`)
- Jira Cloud account with API token
- Plane instance with API key

## Setup

```bash
# Clone or copy the project
cd plane-jira-importer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

### Getting Jira credentials

1. Go to [Atlassian API tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Create a new API token
3. Note your Jira host (e.g., `your-company.atlassian.net`)
4. Use the email associated with your Atlassian account

### Getting Plane credentials

1. Go to your Plane instance → Settings → API Tokens
2. Create a new API token
3. Note your workspace slug from the URL (e.g., `https://plane.example.com/my-workspace/` → `my-workspace`)

### Environment variables

#### Required

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `JIRA_HOST` | Jira Cloud hostname (without `https://`) | `acme.atlassian.net` |
| `JIRA_EMAIL` | Email for Jira authentication | `you@acme.com` |
| `JIRA_API_TOKEN` | Jira API token | `abc123...` |
| `PLANE_HOST` | Full URL of your Plane instance | `https://plane.acme.com` |
| `PLANE_API_KEY` | Plane API key | `pl_...` |
| `PLANE_WORKSPACE_SLUG` | Plane workspace slug | `acme` |

#### Optional tuning

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `JIRA_RATE_LIMIT` | `30` | Jira API requests per minute |
| `PLANE_RATE_LIMIT` | `60` | Plane API requests per minute |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | Retry attempts for transient API failures |
| `MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE_MB` | `100` | Skip attachments larger than this (MB) |
| `DEBUG` | — | Set to `1` for full error stack traces |

## Usage

### Interactive mode (recommended)

```bash
npm start
```

The tool will:
1. List your Jira projects — pick one
2. List your Plane projects — pick one
3. Show Jira statuses — map each to a Plane state
4. Show Jira assignees — map each to a Plane member
5. Run the migration with progress reporting

### Non-interactive mode

```bash
# Specify projects directly
npm start -- --project-key MYPROJ --plane-project <plane-project-uuid>

# Preview without making changes
npm start -- --dry-run

# Combine flags
npm start -- --project-key MYPROJ --plane-project <uuid> --dry-run
```

### CLI flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Preview migration without creating anything in Plane |
| `--reimport` | Update all previously migrated issues (skips the interactive prompt) |
| `--project-key KEY` | Skip Jira project selection, use this project key |
| `--plane-project ID` | Skip Plane project selection, use this project UUID |

## What gets migrated

| Jira | Plane | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Summary | Work item name | |
| Description (HTML) | `description_html` | Rendered HTML from Jira |
| Status | State | Mapped interactively |
| Priority | Priority | Highest→urgent, High→high, Medium→medium, Low/Lowest→low |
| Assignee | Assignees | Mapped interactively (auto-matched by email) |
| Issue type | Label | Created as "Jira: Bug", "Jira: Story", etc. |
| Due date | Target date | |
| Start date | Start date | From `customfield_10015` if available |
| Parent/sub-task | Parent link | Preserves hierarchy |
| Comments | Comments | Includes "Originally by {author} on {date}:" prefix |
| Attachments | Attachments | Downloaded from Jira, uploaded to Plane storage |
| Issue key | Reference link | Added to description as a link back to Jira |

### What's NOT migrated

- Custom fields (beyond start date)
- Watchers / followers
- Sprint information
- Workflow transitions / history
- Time tracking

## Error handling

The tool is designed to be resilient:

- **Transient API errors** (5xx, 429, network timeouts) are retried with exponential backoff and jitter. The `Retry-After` header is respected when present.
- **Per-issue isolation** — if one issue fails to migrate (e.g., a persistent API error), the tool logs the failure and continues with the remaining issues.
- **Comment & attachment failures** are handled individually — a failed attachment won't prevent other attachments or comments from being migrated on the same issue.
- **Attachment size limits** — files exceeding `MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE_MB` are skipped before downloading, avoiding unnecessary bandwidth and memory usage.

At the end of each run, a summary report shows exactly what succeeded, what failed, and why:

```
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Migration Summary
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Total issues:           60
  ✓ Migrated:             57
  ○ Skipped (existing):   3
  
  Comments migrated:      142
  Attachments migrated:   23
  Attachments skipped:    2 (size limit)
  
  Duration:               4m 32s
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Incremental migration

The tool tracks which issues have been migrated using `external_id` (Jira issue key) and `external_source` ("jira-importer"). Running the tool again on the same project will prompt you to choose:

- **Import new only** — skip previously migrated issues, only create new ones
- **Update all** — update existing migrated issues with the latest Jira data and import any new ones (comments and attachments are also de-duplicated)

You can also pass `--reimport` to skip the prompt and update all.

This makes it safe to re-run after failures — already-migrated issues won't be duplicated, and you can update them if the source data changed.

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing environment variables"
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all values.

### "Jira API error 401"
Check your `JIRA_EMAIL` and `JIRA_API_TOKEN`. The token may have expired.

### "Jira API error 410"
The Jira search endpoint was updated. Make sure you're running the latest version of this tool which uses `/rest/api/3/search/jql`.

### "Plane API error 401"
Check your `PLANE_API_KEY`. Ensure it has workspace-level permissions.

### "Plane API error 429"
The rate limiter should handle this automatically. If you see repeated 429 errors, try lowering `PLANE_RATE_LIMIT` (e.g., `30`).

### Large migrations (1000+ issues)
- Expect ~2-3 seconds per issue due to rate limiting
- The tool is fault-tolerant: if it crashes or is interrupted, re-run it and it will skip already-migrated issues
- Consider lowering rate limits if you see frequent retries
- Set `MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE_MB` to skip very large files
